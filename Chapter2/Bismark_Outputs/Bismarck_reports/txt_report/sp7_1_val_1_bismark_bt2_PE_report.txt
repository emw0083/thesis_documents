Bismark report for: sp7_1_val_1.fq and sp7_2_val_2.fq (version: v0.23.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/beegfs/home/aubemw001/wilkins_files/trim_data/genome_mapping/ with the specified options: -q --local --score-min G,20,8 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	128657015
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	95057258
Mapping efficiency:	73.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	13681395
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	19918362
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	511

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	47570586	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	47486161	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
