Bismark report for: ft6_1_val_1.fq and ft6_2_val_2.fq (version: v0.23.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/beegfs/home/shared/strader_research/Spurp/EMseq_2021/trimagalore_output/Spurp_genome/ with the specified options: -q --local --score-min G,20,8 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	99274409
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	70005148
Mapping efficiency:	70.5% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	13685537
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	15583724
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	488

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:

GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	34976728	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
